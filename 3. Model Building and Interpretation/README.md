# Model Building and Interpretation

## Background information

Here is the background information on your task
It is now time to get started with some machine learning!

The client has provided 3 datasets, it is now your job to combine, transform and model these datasets in a suitable way to answer the problem statement that the business has requested.

Most importantly, once the modeling process is complete, we need you to communicate your work and analysis in the form of a single PowerPoint slide, so that we can present the results back to the business. The key here is to use business-friendly language and to explain your results in a way that the business will understand. For example, ensure that when you’re summarizing the performance of the results you don’t use technical metrics, but rather convert it into numbers that they’ll understand.

## Tasks

You have previously outlined the strategic plan for completing the modeling work based on the problem statement.

It is now time for you to deliver on this strategic plan. Some additional resources have been provided to help you with this task. If you feel comfortable enough to complete this task on your own, use the “modeling.ipynb” Python notebook to get started. However, if you’re not sure where to start and would like to be guided through the modeling process, use the “modeling_walkthrough.ipynb” notebook.

Feel free to use these notebooks in a similar way that we did before, using Google Colab. If you prefer to use them within your own development environment, that’s fine too.

The modeling process should take 35-45 minutes.

Once you’re done with the modeling, summarize your results in a business-friendly single PowerPoint slide. Be sure to explain whether this model can help them to tackle the problem statement.
